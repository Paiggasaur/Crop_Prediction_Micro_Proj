# Crop_Prediction_Micro_Proj
A model trained using the Random Forest Algorithm has been implemented to predict the crops which can grow under cerratin factors.  These factors include, levels of Nitrogen, Pottassium and Phospherous in the soil, the Temperature, pH, Humidity, and Rainfall range. The random forest algorithm was chosen out of 8 tested models as it outperformed the rest with an Accuracy of 96.66%.
The user interface has been created using streamlit.
